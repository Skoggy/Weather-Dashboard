## Deployed App

## Operation
This application is quite simple to use. All you have to do is type in a city name,
and it brings up the current weather, humidity, windspeed and the UV rating.
It also then brings up a five day forecast so that you can plan your week out right.
It keeps track of the cities you have selected previously in the form of buttons, and 
if you want you can clear your history as well.

## Methods used
For this challenging project, I used HTML, a small ammount of CSS, Bootstrap to do all of
the layout, JavaScript and the openweathermap API.

## Future Development
I would like to add some more features and attempt to create the CSS layout manually so 
that I can get some practice with manual layouts. Some other ideas would be to add in 
the ability to chose the city and its country so that some cities that share names
come up when searched.
